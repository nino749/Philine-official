## Philine is a Discord bot that provides an integration of privately hosted AI models.

Currently usable models:
 - Phi4 (slower, but more accurate)
 - Gemma3 (faster, but less accurate)
 - Deepseek-R1 (faster, but less accurate)
 - Qwen2 (good mix of speed and accuracy)
 - Llama3.2 (slow, but high accuracy)

**Keep in mind that these bots run on my server, so it takes time for them to respond.
Slow models are really slow. Often longer than 1-2 min.**

### Privacy policy
We store your messages within the thread for 5 minutes. After that they will be permanently deleted.
We also store your Discord usernames for 5 minutes for the context of the AI.
The code is public on our Github.

@PhilineJS Is programmed in JS by @game.crash and is currently being updated to @PhilinePY.
